# RockPaperScissor
Project Description
The Rock Paper Scissors game is a classic hand game that is often played between two people. In this project, the game is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing a simple yet interactive user experience.

Features
User Interface:

HTML is used to structure the web page, providing buttons for user input (Rock, Paper, Scissors) and displaying the results.
CSS is used to style the buttons and the overall layout, giving the game a visually appealing look.
Game Logic:

JavaScript handles the game logic, determining the winner based on the choices made by the user and the computer.
The computer's choice is randomly generated, ensuring a fair game each time.
Interactivity:

When a user clicks a button (Rock, Paper, or Scissors), the game logic is executed, and the result is displayed on the screen.
The results include the choices made by both the user and the computer, and a message indicating whether the user won, lost, or tied.
How It Works
User Input: The user selects Rock, Paper, or Scissors by clicking one of the buttons on the web page.
Computer Choice: The computer randomly selects Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
Determine Winner: The game logic compares the user's choice with the computer's choice based on the following rules:
Rock crushes Scissors
Scissors cuts Paper
Paper covers Rock
